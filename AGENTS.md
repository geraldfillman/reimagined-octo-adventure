# My_Data Vault

An Obsidian-based investment research system covering housing, biotech, defense, energy, macro, and cross-domain theses. The vault combines structured notes, puller scripts + 10 KB scripts, signal detection, dashboards, graph analysis, OSINT scanning, and thesis monitoring. FMP (free tier) is the active quote backbone, supplemented by free FRED/EIA/CFTC/SEC feeds and manual platform exports (KoyFin, TastyTrade, Unusual Whales). The daily routine is split into daily and weekly cadences with company-risk-scan integrated.

## Multi-Vault Architecture

This system spans three Obsidian vaults. **My_Data is the engine** — all scripts live here and route reads/writes to the appropriate vault via env vars in `.env`.

| Vault | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **My_Data** | `...\My_Data` | Pull/Research engine — data sources, pulls, signals, theses, scripts |
| **Dr_Magnifico** | `...\Dr_Magnifico` | Learning System — `11_Learning/`, daily sessions, nodes, mastery |
| **Oy** | `...\Oy` | KB System — `12_Knowledge_Bases/`, intake-to-wiki pipeline |
| **World_Machine** | `...\World_Machine\My_Data_Archive` | Retention archive — aged pull notes relocated out of the live index |

Routing env vars (set in `My_Data/.env`):
- `LEARNING_VAULT_ROOT` → Dr_Magnifico path (used by `getLearningRoot()` in `config.mjs`)
- `KB_VAULT_ROOT` → Oy path (used by `getKBRoot()` in `config.mjs`)
- `ARCHIVE_VAULT_ROOT` → World_Machine archive path (used by `getArchiveRoot()` in `config.mjs`; defaults to a sibling `World_Machine/My_Data_Archive`)

## Current State

- `9` MOC files provide the top-level navigation layer (including `moc-company-risk` and `moc-company-intel`).
- `22` dashboards provide the main operator surfaces (including 2 Company Risk dashboards, the Company Intel Board, and the Health Review Board).
- `24` canonical templates live in `03_Templates/` (including 5 Company Risk templates and 3 Company Intel templates).
- `24` active thesis notes plus `19` sector/style baskets are tracked in `10_Theses/`.
- Active puller scripts live in `scripts/pullers/`, including `sector-scan` and 11 OSINT/social scanners.
- `10` KB scripts live in `scripts/kb/` — the intake-to-wiki pipeline (`kb ingest`, `kb normalize`, `kb classify`, `kb compile`, `kb query`, `kb librarian`, `kb health`, `kb transcribe`, `kb suggest`, `kb dispatch`).
- `sector-scan`, `conviction-delta`, validation, cleanup, retention, and signal-aware scorecard updates are live.
- FMP is the active quote, screener, technical, and watchlist backbone.

## Completed So Far

- Built the vault structure, schema system, templates, MOCs, dashboards, and CLI pull framework.
- Implemented the thesis-driven signal system with pull notes, signal notes, and Dataview aggregation.
- Brought `sector-scan` live with sector evidence collection, thesis routing, signal writing, emerging-pattern stubs, and bridge-note support.
- Added `conviction-delta` plus signal-aware thesis scorecard updates to support rolling conviction and allocation suggestions.
- Recalibrated sector routing to reduce broad false positives and lower default stub churn.
- Added sector-specific SEC snapshot handling so sector evidence remains stable and reviewable.
- Retired local Qlib/quant workflows; restore or reinstall only if a concrete use case returns.
- Integrated InfraNodus graph-session generation for structural analysis across notes and folders.
- Moved the financial-data workflow to FMP free tier + free government APIs; premium-only endpoints are being audited and rerouted.
- Added local operator dashboard (`node run.mjs dashboard`) with Signal Board, Thesis Status, Pull Health, Technical Risk, Earnings Calendar, and live Data Collection panels.
- Added `fmp --quote`, `fmp --technical`, `fmp --earnings-calendar`, and `fmp --thesis-watchlists`.
- Added thesis-level `node run.mjs thesis-fmp-sync` to project FMP tape and catalyst data into thesis frontmatter.
- Added batch thesis watchlist pull notes that combine quotes, warmed FMP fundamentals, technicals, earnings timing, and optional thesis-basket coverage.
- `fmp --thesis-watchlists` now warms the local FMP fundamentals cache so thesis sync and full-picture reports can inherit valuation and quality fields more reliably.
- Added `node run.mjs thesis-catalysts` plus the `Catalyst Radar` dashboard for symbol-level catalyst review across theses.
- Added `node run.mjs thesis-full-picture` plus the `Full Picture Reports` dashboard for one-note structural + tactical thesis synthesis.
- Improved thesis full-picture macro matching so indicator links can resolve through direct series IDs, indicator-note aliases, grouped macro pulls, BEA-style single-metric notes, and the local VIX bridge note.
- Added `node run.mjs macro-bridges` to normalize Debt/GDP, DXY proxy, Defense Budget proxy, Gold, and Bitcoin into one macro bridge note for thesis report coverage.
- Added `node run.mjs nahb --builder-confidence` for official builder-sentiment evidence and `node run.mjs federalregister --faa-uas` for official FAA drone rulemaking evidence.
- Added high-priority official and library source notes for unresolved indicators, including NAHB HMI, FAA rulemaking, World Gold Council Goldhub, IMF IFS, ProQuest Congressional, Nexis Uni, Janes, Capital IQ Pro, and 451 Research.
- Retired the old legacy market-data operator path in favor of the current FMP workflow.
- Simplified the vault: pruned 223 stale duplicate pull notes, deleted 3 absorbed patch files (`patch-dashboard.mjs`, `patch-phase2.mjs`, `patch-phase3.mjs`), removed 4 orphaned config sources (BLS, Census, NOAA, World Bank), cleared stale FMP/SEC caches, cleaned up archived data source definitions, and deleted empty pull folders.
- Restructured `daily-routine.ps1` into daily + weekly cadences. Daily covers macro/market, SEC thesis, FMP watchlists, sector-scan, and company-risk watchlist. Weekly (`-IncludeWeekly`) adds FEMA, USASpending, FDA, clinical trials, USPTO, arXiv, PubMed, NewsAPI, and full company-risk with score updates.
- Added OSINT intelligence layer: 10 source definitions in `01_Data_Sources/OSINT/` covering SpiderFoot, theHarvester, Amass, Recon-ng, OpenCorporates, ICIJ Offshore Leaks DB, OTX AlienVault, VesselFinder, Bellingcat ADS-B History, and Bellingcat Auto Archiver. Four passive scan scripts wired into `scan osint-*` CLI group. All output to `05_Data_Pulls/osint/`.
- Extended OSINT layer (second pass): added 9 source notes (Phantom Tide, Hormuz Tracker, World Monitor, Leaker, Merklemap, Columbus Project, octosuite, SAR Interference Tracker, Umbra Open Data Tracker) plus osm-search and snscrape. Seven new scan scripts wired — total 11 `scan osint-*` commands. Two learning system resources added to `11_Learning/09_Resources/`.
- Built `12_Knowledge_Bases/` KB subsystem: 19-directory folder tree, 4 wiki templates, Dataview wiki index, and 10 KB pipeline scripts (`kb ingest` → `kb normalize` → `kb classify` → `kb compile` → `kb query`). Health tools: `kb librarian` (lint + auto-fix), `kb health` (integrity checks), `kb suggest` (gap analysis), `kb transcribe` (meeting extraction). Wired into router.mjs as the `kb` CLI group.
- Wired KB raw mirroring into `writeNote()` via `scripts/lib/kb-bridge.mjs`. **Retired 2026-08-01** — the automatic mirror duplicated every pull note into KB raw folders that mostly went unprocessed; use manual `kb ingest` to bring specific documents into the KB pipeline instead.
- Built the **Company Intel** subsystem (2026-08-01) from the EDGAR Company Deconstruction & Intelligence Framework: playbook reference in `04_Reference/`, `Company_Dossier` + `Intel_Finding` templates, `13_Company_Intel/` (Companies + Findings), Company Intel Board dashboard, `moc-company-intel`, and a keyless `edgar` CLI group (`scaffold` / `baseline` / `facts`) built on `scripts/lib/edgar.mjs` with unit tests. Pull notes land in `05_Data_Pulls/Edgar/`.
- Built the **Health Review** layer (2026-08-02) from the Corporate Health, Integrity & Market-Behavior Framework: method reference in `04_Reference/Corporate_Health_Integrity_Framework.md`, `Health_Review` template, `13_Company_Intel/Reviews/` (one dated scored review per company per quarter), Health Review Board dashboard, and `edgar health` CLI (§5 screening bands from XBRL + §9.2 relative performance via Yahoo, band math in `scripts/lib/health-markers.mjs` with stale-tag guards, unit tests in `scripts/tests/edgar-health.test.mjs`). Leverage bands auto-suppressed for bank/REIT filers per framework §14.
- Upgraded the learning system to **Adaptive Generalist System V2**: replaced the 11-step session monolith with an 8-step Daily Engine (due-review-queue-first); added retrieval lifecycle fields (`next_review_due`, `retrieval_success_count`, `retrieval_failure_count`, `misconception_log`, etc.) to all 16 mastery notes and templates; rebuilt the Mastery Dashboard with 6 Dataview blocks; added hard 50% domain balance cap; added project promotion gate enforcement and conflict flagging; created `Link_Integrity_Report.md`; added 3 new maintenance scripts (`learning-review.ps1`, `learning-project-audit.ps1`, `learning-link-audit.ps1`) and V2 validation checks to `learning-daily.ps1`.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `000-moc/` | 8 Master of Content navigation files - read before exploring raw notes |
| `00_Dashboard/` | 20 primary Dataview dashboards - start here for current operator state |
| `01_Data_Sources/` | 87 active source definitions across 16 categories (including OSINT/) |
| `03_Templates/` | 21 canonical templates for all note types |
| `04_Reference/` | Schema docs, graph conventions, pull system guide, source overview boards, and graph-analysis surfaces |
| `05_Data_Pulls/` | Timestamped pull notes from API pullers and synthesis workflows. Aged clear-status notes are relocated out of the vault by `system prune` (see Retention below); the legacy `_archive/` subfolder is git-ignored and Obsidian-excluded. |
| `06_Signals/` | Discrete signal notes when thresholds fire |
| `07_Playbooks/` | Execution playbooks + Graph Sessions subfolder |
| `08_Entities/` | Stocks (103), Sectors (12), Countries (8), Commodities (7), ETFs (1) |
| `09_Macro/` | Indicators (17) and Regimes (9) |
| `10_Theses/` | 24 investment theses with conviction tracking, plus 19 sector/style baskets in `Baskets/` |
| `11_Learning/` | **Moved to Dr_Magnifico vault** — open that vault in Obsidian to access learning content |
| `12_Company_Risk/` | Company Risk Intelligence system — Companies, Events, Patterns, Entities, Transactions subfolders. Pattern recognition for narrative vs. reality misalignment. |
| `12_Knowledge_Bases/` | **Moved to Oy vault** — open that vault in Obsidian to access KB content. Scripts still run from `scripts/kb/` here (manual `kb ingest` only; the automatic pull-note mirror was retired 2026-08-01 and residual local files archived to `500-archive/12_Knowledge_Bases/`). |
| `13_Company_Intel/` | Company deconstruction system (EDGAR framework) — `Companies/` holds living dossiers, `Findings/` holds dated filing-change notes, `Reviews/` holds dated health & integrity reviews. Methods: `04_Reference/EDGAR_Company_Deconstruction_Framework.md` + `04_Reference/Corporate_Health_Integrity_Framework.md`. |
| `500-archive/` | Retired or deprioritized data sources; do not link from active notes |
| `scripts/` | Node.js automation (pullers, validator, InfraNodus, cleanup, KB routing) |

## Naming Conventions

- Pull notes: `YYYY-MM-DD_Name.md` (date-stamped, path-safe)
- Entity files: Match the canonical name (for example `AAPL.md`, `Tech Sector.md`)
- Source categories must match folder names exactly (see `04_Reference/Vault_Schemas.md` for the 16 valid categories)

## Wiki Links And Graph Connectivity

Use `[[wikilinks]]` in frontmatter arrays to create graph edges:

```yaml
bullish_drivers: ["[[Rate Cut Cycle]]", "[[Weak USD]]"]
core_entities: ["[[DHI]]", "[[LEN]]", "[[Housing]]"]
parent_regimes: ["[[Rate Cut Cycle]]"]
```

See `04_Reference/Graph Conventions.md` for the full linking protocol.

## Pull System (CLI)

All commands run from `scripts/`. The CLI uses a grouped grammar:

```
node run.mjs <group> <command> [options]
```

Run `node run.mjs help` for overview. Run `node run.mjs <group> --help` for group detail.
Full command inventory: `node run.mjs help` and `node run.mjs <group> --help`

> Legacy flat aliases (`thesis-fmp-sync`, `conviction-delta`, etc.) were retired
> 2026-08 — the CLI prints the grouped replacement and exits if you use one.

**Optional setup** (install once for enhanced features):
- `npm install -g defuddle` — enables clean markdown extraction when ingesting URLs via `kb ingest --url`
- Obsidian CLI must be open for `obsidian-cli.mjs` property sync to fire (safe no-op if closed)

Morning sequence details are documented in `04_Reference/Pull_System_Guide.md`.
The daily routine (`daily-routine.ps1`) is split into two cadences:
- **Daily:** FRED rates/housing/labor, FMP SPY quote, Treasury yields, SEC thesis, FMP thesis watchlists, sector-scan, company-risk watchlist scan
- **Weekly (`-IncludeWeekly`):** OpenFEMA, USASpending, FDA, clinical trials, USPTO, arXiv, PubMed, NewsAPI, full company-risk with score updates

```powershell
powershell scripts/daily-routine.ps1               # daily cadence only
powershell scripts/daily-routine.ps1 -IncludeWeekly # daily + weekly
powershell scripts/daily-routine.ps1 -DryRun         # preview without API calls
```

### Maintenance Scripts

`11_Learning/Learning System.canvas` — the V2 session workflow: Daily Engine 8-step flow, active session file, domain balance scoreboard, project health tracker, mastery dashboard, nodes/connections reference.

### Session Workflow — V2 Daily Engine (30–45 min)

> **Core directive:** Optimize for durable learning artifacts — nodes, connections, mastery updates. The session note is a workspace log, not the learning product.

1. **Due Review Queue** ← *retrieve from memory before opening notes; score recall first*
2. **Surface Retrieval Check** ← *pause, answer before proceeding*
3. **Node Build or Refinement** — create or improve one node (mechanism-first, with example)
4. **Connection Creation** — minimum 1 connection per session; explain why it matters
5. **Optional Discovery Pass** — skip if due review queue was full
6. **Project Review Touch** — review active project state only; do not activate new projects here
7. **Advanced or Transfer Check** ← *pause, answer before mastery update*
8. **Mastery Update** — update only based on demonstrated evidence from Steps 1–7

**Deep Dive Mode** (60–120 min, optional): use only when a node keeps recurring, a project needs deeper context, or retrieval failures are repeated. Must still produce ≥ 1 node and ≥ 1 connection.

**Anti-drift rules:** ≥ 1 node built or refined · ≥ 1 connection created · due review queue run first · no session completes with zero graph output

### Domain Balance Rule

**Hard rule:** No single domain may exceed **50% of sessions** over any rolling 14-day window, unless **Special Campaign Mode** is declared explicitly at session start (capped at 7 days). The Economics / Markets cluster (Macro, Market_Structure, Sectors, Fundamentals, Risk, Foundations) counts as one domain group for this calculation. Weekly reviews must cover ≥ 4 distinct domains. Flag any domain with 0 sessions in 14 days as a blind spot.

### Mastery Fields Reference

Each `05_Mastery/*.md` file uses both YAML frontmatter and inline fields (both must be kept in sync — server reads inline fields via `parseInlineFields()`):

| Field | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `topic_id` | string | Must match Topic Registry exactly |
| `domain` | domain folder name | e.g. `Psychology_Behavior` |
| `level` | 0–5 | 0=not started, 5=mastered |
| `confidence` | 0–100 | percentage |
| `stability` | fragile / building / solid / mastered | drives canvas color |
| `progress_state` | active / locked / complete | drives unlock logic |
| `prerequisites` | comma-separated topic_ids or `none` | drives canvas edges and unlock |
| `check_history` | JSON array or comma-separated | last 5 shown as sparkline |
| `next_action` | string | shown in Observatory recommendation |
| `next_review_due` | YYYY-MM-DD | drives due-review queue in dashboard Block 1 |
| `retrieval_success_count` | integer | incremented on each successful blank-page recall |
| `retrieval_failure_count` | integer | incremented on each failed retrieval attempt |
| `last_successful_retrieval` | YYYY-MM-DD | date of last passed retrieval |
| `last_failed_retrieval` | YYYY-MM-DD | date of last failed retrieval |
| `delayed_check_history` | array | log of delayed check scores |
| `transfer_evidence` | array | instances where concept was applied cross-domain |
| `misconception_log` | array | logged errors, near-misses, collapsed explanations |
| `active_mode` | review / build / maintain | current learning phase for this topic |

Additional PowerShell scripts in `scripts/`:
- `update-thesis-monitor.ps1` - updates `monitor_status` and `monitor_last_review` across thesis notes
- `update-thesis-scorecards.ps1` - applies machine-managed thesis monitoring, conviction, and allocation suggestion fields, including `-ApplySignals` and `-DryRun`

### API Keys

> **2026-08 market-data policy:** FMP is FREE tier (~250 calls/day). Quotes and
> OHLCV history are served **Yahoo-first** (`scripts/lib/yahoo-client.mjs`,
> keyless) with FMP as fallback. FMP quota is reserved for what Yahoo cannot
> provide: statements, float, insiders, short interest, news, earnings,
> screeners. When neither source can fill a field, leave it blank/null and let
> the note show the gap explicitly — never fabricate a value.

## InfraNodus Integration

Graph measurement workflow is documented in `04_Reference/InfraNodus Graph Measurements.md`.

- Run `node run.mjs system infranodus --path <scope>` to generate a graph session note
- Sessions are saved to `07_Playbooks/Graph_Sessions/`
- Best scopes: `10_Theses/`, `08_Entities/`, `09_Macro/`, `05_Data_Pulls/<domain>/`
- Plugin defaults: Wiki Links Prioritized for folders, Wiki Links + Concepts for single notes

## Retired Quant Layer

Qlib and QCPM have been removed from the active vault. Do not add `qlib_*` thesis frontmatter, `05_Data_Pulls/Quant/` notes, or `node run.mjs quant` workflows unless the quant layer is intentionally rebuilt.

## Signal System

Pull notes fire signals at 4 severity levels: `clear`, `watch`, `alert`, `critical`. The Signal Board dashboard (`00_Dashboard/Signal Board.md`) aggregates all non-clear signals. Discrete signal notes in `06_Signals/` document significant events with implications and related domains.

## Dashboards

All dashboards use Dataview queries against frontmatter fields. They render automatically in Obsidian with the Dataview plugin enabled. Key dashboards:

- **Signal Board** - Active alerts and watch items across all domains
- **Catalyst Radar** - Symbol-level catalyst notes that combine thesis monitoring, earnings timing, and technical state
- **Full Picture Reports** - Generated thesis synthesis notes that combine structural thesis state with tape, macro, and fundamentals
- **Cross-Domain Thesis Board** - Multi-domain signal convergence
- **Capital Allocation Board** - Thesis rankings, conviction, sizing guidance, catalysts
- **High Priority Thesis Monitor** - Weekly review surface for highest-conviction theses
- **Data Freshness Monitor** - Stale data detection
- **Macro Regime Tracker** - Rate, labor, inflation, GDP data
- **Network Graph** - Entity connectivity and orphan detection
- **InfraNodus Measurements** - Graph session entry point and hub/bridge analysis
- **Company Risk Board** - Active watchlist sorted by risk score, recent events feed, pattern exposure heatmap
- **Company Risk Patterns** - Pattern library, entity network, transaction log, risk score distribution
- **Company Intel Board** - Dossier coverage by state (green/yellow/orange/red), findings feed, filing-baseline freshness
- **Health Review Board** - Health & integrity review scores (§16), red-flag overrides, divergence patterns, falsifiable checkpoints due

## Dashboard

A local operator dashboard runs at `http://localhost:3737` via `node run.mjs system dashboard`.

It reads vault files directly (no separate sync) and provides seven panels:

| Panel | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Signal Board | All signal notes grouped by severity (critical/alert/watch/clear) |
| Thesis Status | Active theses sorted by allocation rank with conviction and monitor status |
| Pull Health | Per-source staleness grid (green=today, yellow=1-2d, red=3+d or never) |
| Technical Risk | Latest FMP technical snapshots with bias, RSI, and moving-average damage |
| Earnings Calendar | Latest FMP earnings calendar range with upcoming rows and catalyst timing |
| Data Collection | Quick-action buttons + per-puller buttons with live SSE output stream |
| Live Terminal | Streams stdout/stderr from spawned puller commands in real time |

API endpoints (all served from the same port):
- `GET /api/theses`, `/api/signals`, `/api/signal-board`, `/api/pull-health`, `/api/technical-risk`, `/api/earnings-calendar`, `/api/status`
- `POST /api/run` - spawn a command, returns `{ jobId }`
- `GET /api/stream/:jobId` - Server-Sent Events stream of job output

Set `DASHBOARD_PORT` to use a port other than `3737`.

## Potential Roadmap

### Near Term

- Extend thesis notes and dashboards with more FMP-derived valuation, trend, and catalyst fields.
- Continue monitoring `sector-scan` live runs and only tighten routing where repeated noise appears.
- Extend the active FMP surface with richer valuation, catalyst, and cross-basket coverage where it improves operator speed.

### Medium Term

- Extend the batch FMP watchlist-report workflow from thesis watchlists into sector baskets.
- Expand company-level catalyst notes into catalyst clustering and sector-level aggregation.
- Improve report generation speed by leaning harder on FMP batch endpoints and cached fundamentals.
- Expand operator boards around conviction momentum, catalyst clustering, and technical deterioration.

### Later / Optional

- Evaluate a structured paid news source to improve company-specific and thesis-specific routing beyond generic headline pulls.
- If FMP is later upgraded to a paid tier, add transcript workflows, ETF holdings, 13F ownership, and broader global comparison surfaces.
- Build more formal portfolio-monitoring and capital-allocation automation on top of the conviction and signal layers.

## Validation

Run `node run.mjs system validate` before committing. The validator checks required frontmatter fields, category alignment, boolean types, valid signal statuses, and thesis FMP summary fields.

## Retention

Pull notes accumulate without bound (the Market domain alone generates thousands of files), which inflates the Obsidian/Dataview index and slows dashboards. Retention keeps the live tree small:

- `system prune --all-domains --older-than 90` relocates aged **clear**-status pull notes (not referenced by any `06_Signals/` note) out of the vault into the external archive (`getArchiveRoot()` → `World_Machine/My_Data_Archive` by default), preserving a `YYYY-MM/Domain/` layout. It is wired into the **monthly** cadence.
- `system cleanup --market-history --signals` deletes redundant intraday market history and expired low-severity signals (daily cadence).
- The legacy in-vault `05_Data_Pulls/_archive/` is git-ignored and listed in Obsidian's excluded files (`.obsidian/app.json` → `userIgnoreFilters`), so it no longer counts against the index. To reclaim disk, move it into `World_Machine/My_Data_Archive/` — it is already untracked and de-indexed.

## Immutability

When working with vault data, always create new notes rather than overwriting existing pull notes. Pull notes are timestamped snapshots, so historical data is preserved rather than updated in place.
